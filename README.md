Unstructured NLP Lab: Question-Answering Model Development
This repository contains our final project for the Unstructured Information Management course, where we have developed and refined a Question-Answering (QA) model. The project is structured into three key phases:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Phase ‚Äì We designed a preliminary model to experiment with QA concepts, refine approaches, and validate core functionalities using a small dataset sample.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Optimization Phase ‚Äì We improved the model by implementing a more advanced and functional QA pipeline, incorporating additional validation techniques to enhance performance.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Final Phase ‚Äì We conducted final tests and built a BERT-based model, integrating an ask_question function to evaluate responses and model accuracy.

üöÄ Our goal is to create a robust and efficient QA system while exploring state-of-the-art NLP techniques. We welcome feedback and suggestions for further improvements!
